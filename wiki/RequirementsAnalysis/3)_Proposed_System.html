<h2 >Scenario<a href="#Scenario" class="wiki-anchor">&para;</a></h2>


After a busy week of midterms and assignments, Gale just wants go home for some stuffed turkey, mashed potatoes, gravy and pumpkin pie. His parents can’t pick him up from University so he needs to find a ride home. It’s a few days till he wants to go home and tickets for trains and busses are as expensive as his textbooks. Gale’s friend Isabelle-Bader recently told him about this nifty piece of software: RideFind. Gale opens up his fruit machine and downloads the program. He opens RideFind and is welcomed by a login screen:
	<ul>
	<li>Sign up for RideFind.</li>
		<li>Name</li>
		<li>University student email (verified by university) </li>
		<li>Password (and password confirmation)</li>
		<li>Birthday</li>
		<li>Gender</li>
		<li>Mobile phone</li>
		<li>Car model (if applicable/optional)</li>
	</ul>


	<p>Gale ponders the meaning of “car model.” Unfortunately, Gale’s parents didn’t pitch to fund for his own car, so he just continues with the passenger login.</p>


Two buttons appear on the screen:
	<ul>
	<li>Looking for a ride?</li>
		<li>Offering a ride?</li>
	</ul>


	<p>Gale is happy with the simplicity of this user interface. He clicks “Looking for a ride?” The screen then changes to a screen of listings, he’s a little confused but he figures it out by looking at the conveniently named headings: “Driver Name,” “Destination,” “Departure Location,” “Date of Departure,” “Time of Departure,” and an icon representing the number of seats left in the car. <br />He notices the “Search” bar. He types in his commute “from,” commute “to,” and “departure date.” <br />The listings update corresponding to his search. He finds a ride, clicks on the Driver’s profile, and notices the positive reviews. He clicks “book a ride,” and clicks on the empty window seat in the car. He also notes the handy “message” icon, so if he needs to contact the driver, he can do so.  As soon as the ride is booked, a window pops up with two buttons: “Pay now with Tilt,” (OPTIONAL FEATURE DEPENDING ON PROGRESS) or “Pay later with cash.” He already has a Tilt account and pays the fee so he doesn’t have to take out cash later. Gale signs out of his RideFind account, and adds the ride into his calendar. <br />On the day of his ride, he meets up at the departure destination and gets into the window seat. A few hours later, Gale is home sweet home.</p>
