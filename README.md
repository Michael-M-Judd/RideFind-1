# RideFind
What is RideFind??? 

"RideFind is a ridesharing application that emphasizes simplicity and ease of use, built by students--for students. As university        students, we understand the way you move. RideFind enables you to share your commute with others travelling to the same location,        sharing costs, and minimizing environmental impact. We aim to connect students with their destinations through safe, reliable, and        easy to use service--one ride at a time."
  
This was a final project for the CISC320 (Fundamentals of Software Development) course at Queen's University. As a final project, students would gain practice following agile methodologies and in developing a small-scale, yet highly functional C++ programs. I worked on a team with Michael Judd, Parv Mital, Xi Wang, Parv Mital, Megan Parker, and Dominique Flabbi to create RideFind.

The front-end of this project was done in C# and C++ while the back end was done in mySQL. Unfortunately although we were not able to fully integrate our front and back ends, we were able to modify our program to work with text files for the sake of showing a demo. There are two branches in this repository, one for the version with the mySQL back-end and one with the text file workaround.
