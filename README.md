# RideFind
This was a final project for the CISC320 (Fundamentals of Software Development) course at Queen's University. As a final project, students would gain practice following agile methodologies and in developing a small-scale, yet highly functional C++ program. I worked on a team with Michael Judd, Parv Mital, Xi Wang, Parv Mital, Megan Parker, and Dominique Flabbi to create RideFind.
